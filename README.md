##To Start

To view the app, clone the repo and cd to the directory. Assuming that you have MongoDB installed, type mongod to start the database. In another tab in the same directory, launch the node server.

####Technologies Used:
 * MongoDB
 * Express
 * Angular
 * Node
 * Webpack


##Design Thoughts
I find that the best way to learn a new framework or language is to build a CRUD app in it. This simple app allows you to create a todo list that persists data to a database.

I used Angular as a MVC framework, making calls to my database to allow the user to create, read, update, and delete data.
